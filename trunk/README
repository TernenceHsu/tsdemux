Summary:
========

This directory contains the source code for tsdemux.
TS is the abbreviation of "Transport Stream".He is send the subcontractor,
each package is 188 bytes long. In the TS stream can fill in the data of 
many types, such as video, audio, custom information, etc. His package 
structure, baotou is 4 bytes, the load of 184 bytes (the 184 bytes are 
not necessarily valid data, there are some possible to populate the data).
Main reference VLC software parsing and ISO/IEC 13818-1 standard.

TS stream can composite a lot of video and audio programs, but the decoder
is how to distinguish? The answer lies in PMT list, as its name shows
the mapping table. He is to solve the problem. Now to see the stream_type
in the PMT structure, elementary_PID these two elements, one used to 
determine the latter as the logo before what is the content of the PID, 
audio or video, etc. And note they are not only one, so they is read 
by cycle to ensure that all the values are read, cycle, of course, 
there are provisions (specific see adjustment function).
